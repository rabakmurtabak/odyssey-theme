			<h2>ESB Methodology</h2>
			<h3>Ebbinghaus' Memory Theory</h3>
			<p>
				Ebbinghaus' Memory Theory emphasizes the importance of spaced repetition for long-term retention of knowledge. At our tuition center, we structure lessons to incorporate frequent reviews and spaced intervals, helping students commit key concepts to memory over time. By revisiting material at regular intervals, we ensure students retain what they’ve learned, minimizing forgetfulness and enhancing recall during exams.
			</p>
			<h3>Socratic Approach</h3>
			<p>
				The Socratic Approach encourages critical thinking by asking students thought-provoking questions, fostering deeper understanding. Instead of simply providing answers, we guide students to discover solutions themselves. This method develops independent problem-solving skills and enhances their ability to analyze and break down complex topics. In group settings, students engage in discussions, improving their reasoning and communication abilities.
			</p>
			<h3>Bruner's Scaffolding Technique</h3>
			<p>
				Bruner’s Scaffolding Technique supports students by providing structured guidance at the beginning of their learning journey. As they gain confidence and competence, we gradually remove the support, allowing them to take full ownership of their learning. This method builds a strong foundation in difficult subjects, ensuring students can tackle increasingly challenging material with independence and confidence.
